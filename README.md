Please note that after trying out Github as our project repository, we found it clunky and difficult to use for collaboration.
Github is designed for software development, which is typically very fragmented.
Working collaboratively on larger files (word documents, etc) created many collisions.
We switched to using a mix of Discord and Google Drive for our work.
We have now uploaded all revisions of our project documents as well as some of our Discord conversations here.
